        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <p>I'm currently studying full stack development via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. It's a 1000-hour long course that teaches HTML, CSS, JS, Git, Ruby, SQL, Rails, Angular, React, and Vue.</p>

        <p>But how did I get here? Why programming? Why web development?</p>

        <h3>If-Then-Else</h3>

        <p>As a child I played video games. My favourite series was Final Fantasy and I wanted more. When we got an internet connection about 20 years ago, I learned how to download older Final Fantasy games not released in Finland. But it wasn't enough. I wanted to make my own games.</p>

        <p>I discovered RPG Maker, a tool to make your own role-playing games.</p>

        <p>One of my strongest memories from RPG Maker is the programming concept if-then-else. For example: if a treasure chest is still unopened, then get treasure, else get nothing. I thought: "Wow, this is how games work!"</p>

        <h3>Loops</h3>

        <p>As a teenager I started to make my own music. I made rap beats that apparently sounded like video game music. Both genres heavily utilize loops: rap beats are repetitive and video game music usually loops until you reach the next area or event.</p>

        <p>Loops are another important programming concept. With if-then-else and loops, you can apparently program anything. So I was well prepared already at a young age :)</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>

        <p>I studied Media Engineering in university 2008&ndash;2014, with a focus on web development. I found it fun and full of potential. I also studied the basics of compter science and created a small music-composing progam in Java.</p>

        <p>But I spent several years on "side quests" before getting back to web development.</p>

        <h3>Japanese + Concerts</h3>

        <p>I went to Japan in 2009 and fell in love with the language, the country and game music concerts. I decided to learn Japanese and figure out how I could produce game music concerts myself. After a few years of interviewing people involved in concerts I was ready.</p>

        <p>In 2016 I founded my own company and produced concerts in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. My biggest event was Helsinki Game Music Festival in 2018. The festival had ~100 musicians (12 different musical groups) and ~1000 attendees, and was broadcasted in Finnish national TV news.</p>

        <p>I also worked as a Japanese teacher and translator. I have achieved the highest level in the standardized Japanese-Language Proficiency Test.</p>

        <h3>Back to Web Development</h3>

        <p>During my "side quest years" I had web app ideas constantly on the back burner. I planned to develop them as soon as I had the time to learn to program better. But I never had enough time.</p>

        <p>In 2018, I decided to pursue a career in full stack development. It's something I enjoy doing in my free time anyway, and it is the fastest path to leveling up my skills. I have interviewed at several tech companies and am extremely inspired.</p>

        <p>A love for personal development and happiness at work seems to be common a mindset for tech companies. I cannot wait to be part of a positive spiral of helping with code, learning from seniors, learning proper development, becoming better, becoming more useful, taking on bigger roles, and hopefully helping others grow.</p>

        <p>I am currently studying the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/tracks/1" target="_blank">Full Stack Ruby on Rails -course on The Odin Project</a>. Most of my code is on <a href="https://github.com/nikolasbroman/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you are in the Helsinki area and are interested in hiring me, please contact me. Else, thank you for taking the time to read my story. End.</p>
