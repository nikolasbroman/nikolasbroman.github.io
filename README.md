# My Personal Website v1

This website shows off my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as of January 2020.

I made this website, because a company I'm interviewing at asked me to demonstrate my HTML/CSS/JS skills. I hadn't touched front-end stuff in almost a year, so I felt a bit nervous, but I'm happy with what I achieved. I hope you like it too.

Be sure to checkout:
- how clicking on nav links results in smooth scrolling in all situations
- how the header hides on scroll down (and shows on scroll up), but doesn't hide if scrolling is happening because a nav link was clicked
- how the layout is responsive (last change happens at 400px screen width)
